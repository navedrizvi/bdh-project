Notes on https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-and-model-versioning

-- data model versioning
to start tracking file:
```
dvc add data/data.xml
```

DVC stores information about the added file (or a directory) in a special .dvc file named data/data.xml.dvc â€” a small text file with a human-readable format. This metadata file is a placeholder for the original data, and can be easily versioned like source code with Git:
```
git add data/data.xml.dvc data/.gitignore
git commit -m "Add raw data"
```

You can upload DVC-tracked data or model files with dvc push, so they're safely stored remotely. This also means they can be retrieved on other environments later with dvc pull. First, we need to set up a remote storage location:
```
dvc remote add -d storage s3://mybucket/dvcstore
git add .dvc/config
git commit -m "Configure remote storage"
dvc push
```



Retrieving
Having DVC-tracked data and models stored remotely, it can be downloaded when needed in other copies of this project with dvc pull. Usually, we run it after git clone and git pull.
```
dvc pull
```

Making changes
When you make a change to a file or directory, run dvc add again to track the latest version:
```
dvc add data/data.xml
```

Usually you would also run git commit and dvc push to save the changes:
```
git commit data/data.xml.dvc -m "Dataset updates"
dvc push
```


Switching between versions
The regular workflow is to use git checkout first (to switch a branch or checkout a .dvc file version) and then run dvc checkout to sync data:
```
git checkout <...>
dvc checkout
```


To go back to the original version of the data:

```
git checkout HEAD~1 data/data.xml.dvc
dvc checkout
Let's commit it (no need to do dvc push this time since this original version of the dataset was already saved):

git commit data/data.xml.dvc -m "Rev dataset updates"
```

Yes, DVC is technically not even a version control system! .dvc file contents define data file versions. Git itself provides the version control. DVC in turn creates these .dvc files, updates them, and synchronizes DVC-tracked data in the workspace efficiently to match them.
